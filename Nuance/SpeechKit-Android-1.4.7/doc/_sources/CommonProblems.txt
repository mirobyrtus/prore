Solutions to Common Problems
============================
This section addresses some frequently occurring issues and ways in which you can solve them.

* There are compilation errors in the sample application.  Eclipse warns that ``@Override`` is not allowed.

	1. Check to make sure that you have version 1.6 of the Java SDK installed.  The sample application is not compatible with 1.5 or previous versions of Java.

	2. If you do not have version 1.6 of the Java SDK, it can be downloaded from Oracle's website: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

	3. If you have both 1.5 and 1.6 of the Java SDK installed, make sure that Eclipse is set to use 1.6 and not 1.5.

	3a. From the Eclipse menu, select: :menuselection:`Window --> Prefences`

	3b. In the ``Preferences`` pop-up menu, select :menuselection:`Java --> Compiler` from the menu on the left.

	3c. Make sure the `Compiler compliance level:` is set to `1.6`.

	4. If you have project specific settings enabled, it may be necessary to make this change for the `SampleVoiceApp` project also.

	4a. In the `Package Explorer`, right click `SampleVoiceApp` and choose `Properties` from the drop-down menu.

	4b. In the `Properties for SampleVoiceApp` pop-up window, select `Java Compiler` from the menu on the left.

	4c. Make sure the `Compiler compliance level:` is set to `1.6`.

* Speech recognition does not work correctly on the Android Emulator.

	At the time of this writing, audio capture does not work correctly on the emulator.  It is recommended that an actual device be used for testing.
	
* Changing the display orientation between landscape and portrait causes problems during a recognition or vocalization.

	Orientation changes on Android cause the current activity to be destroyed and recreated. 
	Depending on your implementation, your ``Vocalizer`` and/or ``Recognizer`` instances may be tied to the old activity instance.
	See SampleVoiceApp's ``TtsView`` and ``DictationView`` for examples of how to deal with this.
